## Problem Statement
[First Bad Version - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

Tags:  #dsadeck   #arrays #completed / #incomplete
Pattern: [[Binary Search#Floor Ceil]]
Similar to: [Peak Index in a Mountain Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/) |  [Valid Mountain Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array/)

## Solution
``` java
public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
	int start = 0, end = n, mid ;
	while(start <= end) {
		mid = start + (end-start)/2;
		if(isBadVersion(mid)) // mid > key
			end = mid - 1;
		else                  // mid  < key
			start = mid + 1;
	}
	return start;
}
```

### Notes
- A glorfied binary search ceil problem.


## Peak Index in Mountain Array
``` java
public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
	int start = 0, end =arr.length-1;
	while(start < end) {
		int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
		if(arr[mid + 1] > arr[mid]) start = mid + 1;
		else end = mid;
	}
	return start;
}
```

### Notes
- Here we use the binary search ceiling approach
- this allows us to simplify the logic for `(arr[mid+1] > arr[mid])` we can use this, since we dont have to worry about start or end ever being out of bounds, since the loop will break when `start == end` 
	- Firstly `start + (end - start) / 2` will always result in ` start <= mid  < end`. i.e. `mid` will never be equal to `end` since the division operation always returns the `floor` of the result. so when it comes down to 2 adjacent numbers `start` and `end`, mid will always point to `start`
	- secondly instead of returning when the element is found we keep it in range by adjusting `end` to  `end = mid` and not `end = mid - 1` which is typically the case.
	- if the key value is reached, then end will be reassigned to it.
	- at the end `start` and `end` will converge onto a singular value so any which one may be returned
- We can do the same thing the other way around
	- return ceil of the division `int mid = start + (end-start + 1)/2`. at the end `mid` will always point to `end`
	- keep `key` in range by reassigning `start = mid`
	- at the end `start` and `end` will converge onto a singular value so any which one may be returned

``` java
public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
	int start = 0, end =arr.length-1;
	while(start < end) {
		int mid = start + (end-start + 1)/2;
		if(arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]) end = mid- 1;
		else start = mid;
	}
	return start;
}
```
