Hello There ,

Welcome to my little end of these digital woods. I frequently come across  [[thoughts/general-specific problems]] , that there seems to be no easy answer for and I end up having to learn it the hard way myself. I often tend to note down the more tricky parts as I go in Obsidian up till now.  Since it's all markdown anyway I decided to publish them here. These days  they are generally concerning  [Android](/tags/android),  [Software](/tags/software) in general or  [Backend](/tags/backend). 

Some days I will find myself solving [leetcode questions](/dsa). I have been noting down all the solutions since I started grinding in 2021. And since I have been using markdown I published those as well.

On other days when I am doom scrolling twitter and every arm-chair [philosopher](/tags/philosophy) is trying to convince the world that  [[posts/AGI Will Never Be Hostile But Humans Will|AI cannot think]] or that  [[thoughts/Meaning is Objective|all meaning is subjective]], I resist the urge to part-take in a thread war and instead write out my thoughts over here.

As for this blog, you see I was not going to sit around and let all the 'Join my newsletter to 10x ChatGPT' schmucks get ahead of me. So I ended to doing a little digging and searching and made myself this neat little blog using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) .  

You can find my socials along with my resume in the footer. Don't hesitate to reach out. Enjoy!
