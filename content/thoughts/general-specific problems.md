A general-specific problem is a specific general problem that arises after you solve a general problem. What makes such a problem *general-specific* is that, despite being a 'specific' problem (not everyone who faces the general problem ends up facing this specific downstream problem), it is also fairly general (a substantial amount of people end up facing this very specific problem ) 

For example. There are probably a thousand tutorials online showing you how to use  docker with docker-compose to deploy a server along with its database. The [[thoughts/general-specific problems|general-specific problems]] in this case could be 
- to use the docker-compose tooling in a CI CD pipeline
- use mounts and volume to be able to create regular backups of the database

General and specific (fewer) problems, both get disproportionately more attention than they need and [[thoughts/general-specific problems|general-specific problems]] get disproportionately lesser.
