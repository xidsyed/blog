## I asked GPT4 to create a lighter version of the Nord color profile

-   I seriously doubted it could do it. As intelligent as it is, playing with hexcodes, doesn't seem like a very easy task, without any additional tools, on top of that, it had to maintain **306 lines of code** in it's context, and copy it all line for line, without making a single error, only swapping out lighter hex values for darker ones as deemed necessary
-   Fully expecting it to crap itself after the 30th line or so, I decided to help it out a little and offered it 4 replacement 'darker' colors in exchange for the lighter ones

You can view my [complete discussion with GPT4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mxCscZBZv4HqRQJFX-gn_ptv0CRD4XIn/view?usp=share_link) , where I later on ask it to generate a completely new color palette, based on color descriptions, ask it to modify the hexes to incorporate different tones, and even asked it to walk me through the process. It derps a little at the very end, but when prompted with 'can you go back and fix the error you made', it fixes the answer.

## Impressions

What impressed me the most:

1.  It used my replacement colors, only where it deemed necessary.
2.  It compensated the brightness of all the other colors **tastefully**. You can't look at the final result, and suspect that it was not created by a human. It's almost too perfect!!
3.  No mistakes, all the other code as it is, first try.

Here are the results:

These results, are not enough to cover all the colors included in the color profile. Will upload more.
