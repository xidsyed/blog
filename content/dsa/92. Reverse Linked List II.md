## Problem Statement


Pattern: 

---

## Solution
``` java
// successor is the continuation of non-reversed LL
ListNode successor = null;

public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int l, int r) {
	if (l == 1) return reverseN(head, r);
	
	head.next = reverseBetween(head.next, l - 1, r - 1);
	return head;
}

ListNode reverseN(ListNode head, int n) {
	if (n == 1) {
		successor = head.next;
		return head;
	}
	ListNode last = reverseN(head.next, n - 1);
	head.next.next = head;
	head.next = successor;    // instead of pointing to null, point to successor
	return last;
}
```

### Notes
- recursively call `reverseBetween` with `head.next` and at l == 1, `return reverse (head, r)`
- r will have reduced by `l` , so exit condition for `n==1`
- set successor node, and the rest is like [[206. Reverse Linked List]]
