## Solution
``` java
public static ListNode getMid (ListNode head) {
	ListNode slow = head, fast = head; 
	//fast = fast.next; // increment fast to get floor of mid
	
	while (fast!= null && fast.next!=null) {
		slow = slow.next;
		fast = fast.next.next;
	}
	// when fast / fast.next becomes null, slow would have reached floor of mid
	return slow;
}
```

### Notes
- this question asks for ceil of mid, but if we wanted floor of mid we'de have uncommented `fast = fast.next;`
- used in merge sorting linked lists : [[148.Â Sort List]] etc.
