## Solution
``` java
public int minimumMoves(String s) {
	int steps = 0, i = 0, len = s.length();
	while (i < len) {
		if (s.charAt(i) == 'X') { steps++; i+=2; }
		i++;
	}
	return steps;
}
```
TC : $O(n)$
SC : $O(1)$

### Notes
- This is a very simple slightly unintuitive greedy approach problem just like [[Police and Thieves]] 
- You can visualise this as iterating forwards, by the left end of a 3 element long underline/bar. and with every single `step` we take, we try to take out the maximum number of `X's` we can without leaving out a single one!
