## Solution
``` java
public int numIdenticalPairs (int[] nums){
	HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
	// count how many times has this element been repeated in the past for each repetition.
	int totalPrevDuplicates=0;
	for (int num : nums) {
		int freq = map.getOrDefault(num, 0);
		// no. of times num[i] has appeared before added to total
		totalPrevDuplicates += freq;
		map.put(num, ++freq);
	}
	return totalPrevDuplicates;
}
```

### Notes
- Its just like the No. of Handshakes Question 
	- [JAVA | STORY BASED | 0ms | SINGLE PASS | EASY TO UNDERSTAND | SIMPLE | HASHMAP - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/discuss/1457646/JAVA-or-STORY-BASED-or-0ms-or-SINGLE-PASS-or-EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND-or-SIMPLE-or-HASHMAP)
- Here instead of no. of handshakes you have to count, how many pairs does each element form with thos in front of it / how many times is an element repeated in front of it
- Or look at it in reverse
> [!Concept]
> How many elements before this can pair with this element / How many elements before this are duplicates of this element
