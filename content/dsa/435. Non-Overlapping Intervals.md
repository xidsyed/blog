## Problem Statement


Pattern: 

---

## Solution
``` java
public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
	Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
	int prevEnd = Integer.MIN_VALUE, count = 0;
	for (int[] curr : intervals) {
		if(prevEnd > curr[0]){      //curr is overlapping
			count++;
		} else prevEnd = curr[1];   // curr is non-overlapping
	}
	return count;
}
```

### Notes
bascically the inverse of [[452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons]]
`prevEnd` denotes the end of the last **non-overlapping** interval. if any interval overlaps with this interval remove it (increase count), until you find the next **non-overlappping element**
