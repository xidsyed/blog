## Solution
``` java
public int[][] merge (int[][] intervals){
	// Sort by interval start
	Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

	ArrayList<int[]> res = new ArrayList<>();
	int[] currInterval = intervals[0];
	for(int[] newInterval: intervals) {
		if(newInterval[0] <= currInterval[1])
			// extend the end of the currInterval
			currInterval[1] = Math.max(currInterval[1], newInterval[1]);
		else {
			res.add(currInterval);
			// set newInterval as the currInterval
			currInterval = newInterval;
		}
	}
	res.add(currInterval);   // add the final currInterval
	return res.toArray(new int[0][]);
}
```

### Notes
- iterate through all intervals 
	- keep the `currInterval` to compare with the `newInterval`
	- if they overlap, extend the `currInterval` (update the end of `currInterval` to `max(currInterval[1], newInterval[]))`
	- once `currInterval` stops overlapping with `newInterval`, we add the now (extended ) `currentInterval` to `res` arraylist
- finally the last `newInterval` which is either extended in the `if` condition to the `currInterval` or is unique so gets set to `currInterval` in the else block. either ways the final `newInterval` ends up in `currInterval` so we add `currInterval` to result
