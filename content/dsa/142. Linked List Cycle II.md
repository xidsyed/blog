## Problem Statement
[Linked List Cycle II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
![](https://i.imgur.com/UoYyY9w.png)


Pattern: [[Pattern Fast and Slow Pointer}]]

---

## Solution
``` java
public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
	ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
	while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
		slow = slow.next;
		fast = fast.next.next;
		if (slow == fast) break;
	}
	if (fast == null || fast.next == null) return null;
	while (head != slow) {
		head = head.next;
		slow = slow.next;
	}
	return head;
}
```

## Explanation: 
continued from ![[GFG Detect Loop#Why fast pointer skips '1' specifically]]
### How do they meet, and then meet again?

Simply said, when F and S meet at `x + y`
- Length travelled by `S` : `x+y`
- Length travelled by `F`  = `2 (x+y)` (cuz it was moving *2x as fast* as `S`)

The difference of Len(F) - Len(S) = x + y = ? (what). lemme rephrase this, **How much farther did `F` travel than `S` ?** rephrased again...

>  Once `F` had travelled `(x+y)` what was it doing waiting for `S` to catch up? That's right, going around in circles... of size `C`. How many times? Who knows 🤷‍♂️, some constant K or N

we got two pointers, and we know the `head` position of the LL, and the meeting `x+y` position so now how do we find `x` ?

Let's see. `S` enters the circle and meets with `F` at `y` inside the circle. This time, with `S` at an offset of `y` let it go around in circles, till head pointer meets up with it, except since we offset it by `y`, they meet up at `x+y - y -> x` 🤯
