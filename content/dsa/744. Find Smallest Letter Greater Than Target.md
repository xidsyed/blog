## Problem Statement


Tags:  #dsadeck  #arrays #binarysearch 
Pattern: [[Binary Search#Floor Ceil]]

---

## Solution
``` java
public char nextGreatestLetter (char[] letters, char target){
	int start = 0, end = letters.length-1, mid;
	while(start <= end){
		mid = start + (end-start)/2;
		if(target >= letters[mid]) start = mid+1;
		else end = mid-1;
	}
	// wrap around
	return letters[start % letters.length];
}
```

### Notes
- simple binary search but we return first, because after convergence, it will always point to the next/greater element. - ceiling binary search
- also `if(target >= letters[mid])` cuz even if target is found we want the greater element.
