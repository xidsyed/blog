## Problem Statement
[Last Stone Weight II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/
[Aditya Verma : Minimum Subset Difference](https://youtu.be/-GtpxG6l_Mc?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go)

Pattern: [[Pattern DP Subset Sum]] 
Related: [[416. Partition Equal Subset Sum]]

## Solution
This is a minimise subset/partition sum

``` java
Integer[][] dp;  
  
int f(int[] nums, int n, int k) {  
   if (n < 0) return 0;  
   if (dp[n][k] != null) return dp[n][k];  
   if (nums[n] <= k) return dp[n][k] = Math.max(  
         nums[n] + f(nums, n - 1, k - nums[n]),  
         f(nums, n - 1, k)  
      );  
   return dp[n][k] = f(nums, n - 1, k);  
}  
  
public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {  
   int sum = 0 ;  
   for (int num : stones) sum += num;  
   dp = new Integer[stones.length + 1][sum / 2 + 1];  
   int maxPartitionSum = f(stones, stones.length - 1, sum / 2); // find partition w sum <= sum/2  
   return (sum - maxPartitionSum) - maxPartitionSum;   // sum of (second partition - first partition)  
}
```

### Notes
[Logic](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/discuss/294888/JavaC++Python-Easy-Knapsacks-DP/918974)
> For any sequence of operations, the algebra boils down to difference of two sums

For example
```
(((a - b) - c) - d) = a - b - c - d = (a) - (b + c + d)  
((d - (a - b) )- c) = d - a + b - c = (d + b) - (a + c)
```

So all we have to do is find the one of the groups, such that its sum is as close as possible to the other, so if total sum is 24, we have to find the group with sum closest to 12.

Essentially it boils down to an [[Pattern DP Subset Sum]] problem.
