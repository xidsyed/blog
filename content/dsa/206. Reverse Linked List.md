## Problem Statement
[Reverse Linked List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Pattern: 
Related:[[Reverse LinkedList in Groups of K]]

---

## Iterative Solution
``` java
public ListNode reverseList (ListNode head){
	ListNode prev = null, current = head; // next not init cuz head could be null
	while(current != null) {
		ListNode next = current.next;   // store the next ptr
		current.next = prev;            // flip curr nodes next to prev
		
		prev = current;                 // new prev is curr
		current = next;                 // new curr is next
	}
	return prev;
}
```

## Recursive Solution
``` java
public ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
	if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;  // return last node
	
	// GO DOWN
	ListNode last = reverse(head.next);  // goes to the last node
	
	// ON THE WAY UP
	head.next.next = head;                  // point the next node to myself
	
	head.next = null;                       // point myself to null
	
	return last;                         // return last NODE
}
```


### Notes
- the 'point myself to null' line has any meaningful effect, only on the 'first' / 'new last' node.
- Basically
	- go down to the last node and keep returning it on the way back as the new head, no need to touch it.
	- on the way back point every node's next to itself
- ðŸ‘† thats it. .thats the genius explanation
