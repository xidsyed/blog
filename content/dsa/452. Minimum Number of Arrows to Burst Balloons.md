## Problem Statement


Tags:  #dsadeck  #intervals #greedy
Pattern: [[Pattern Activity Selection Problem]]
Related: [[435. Non-Overlapping Intervals]]

---

## Solution
``` java
    public int findMinArrowShots (int[][] points){
        Arrays.sort(points, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        long prevEnd = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] curr : points) {
            if(prevEnd < curr[0]){  // curr is overlapping
                count++;
                prevEnd = curr[1];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```

### Notes
- sort intervals by their `end`s
- every time you come across a non-overlapping element increment `count`
